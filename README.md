All models are designed to work seamlessly with Django Admin:

- **Inline editing** - Car images managed within car records
- **Custom ordering** - Sensible default sorting

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Creating a Car Listing
```python
from myapp.models import Brand, CarModel, Car, Location

# Create or get brand
toyota, created = Brand.objects.get_or_create(
    name="Toyota",
    defaults={'country_of_origin': 'Japan'}
)

# Create or get model
camry, created = CarModel.objects.get_or_create(
    brand=toyota,
    name="Camry",
    defaults={'body_type': 'sedan'}
)

# Create location
nairobi, created = Location.objects.get_or_create(
    name="Nairobi",
    county="Nairobi"
)

# Create car listing
car = Car.objects.create(
    brand=toyota,
    car_model=camry,
    year=2020,
    condition='used_local',
    engine_size=2.5,
    fuel_type='petrol',
    transmission='automatic',
    drive_type='fwd',
    mileage=50000,
    color='Silver',
    doors=4,
    seats=5,
    price=2500000,  # KES 2.5M
    location=nairobi,
    description="Well maintained family car"
)
```

### Adding Car Images
```python
from myapp.models import CarImage

# Add primary image
CarImage.objects.create(
    car=car,
    image='path/to/image.jpg',
    is_primary=True,
    caption='Front view'
)

# Add additional images
CarImage.objects.create(
    car=car,
    image='path/to/interior.jpg',
    order=1,
    caption='Interior view'
)
```

## üîç Search & Filtering

The models support various filtering options:

### Common Filters
```python
# Filter by brand
toyota_cars = Car.objects.filter(brand__name='Toyota')

# Filter by price range
affordable_cars = Car.objects.filter(price__lte=1500000)

# Filter by location
nairobi_cars = Car.objects.filter(location__county='Nairobi')

# Filter available cars
available_cars = Car.objects.filter(status='available')

# Filter by fuel type
hybrid_cars = Car.objects.filter(fuel_type='hybrid')
```

### Advanced Filtering
```python
# Cars under 2M, automatic, in Nairobi
filtered_cars = Car.objects.filter(
    price__lt=2000000,
    transmission='automatic',
    location__county='Nairobi',
    status='available'
).select_related('brand', 'car_model', 'location')
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Foreign key relationships** - Proper indexing for fast queries
- **Select related** - Minimize database hits
- **Image optimization** - Automatic resizing to reduce storage
- **Ordering** - Sensible default ordering for all models

### Recommended Indexes
```python
# Custom indexes for heavy queries
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['brand', 'price']),
        models.Index(fields=['location', 'status']),
        models.Index(fields=['fuel_type', 'transmission']),
    ]
```
